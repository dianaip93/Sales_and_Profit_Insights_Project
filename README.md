### Insights:
How can we maximize profitability while maintaining strong revenue growth?
Bundling high-margin accessories (helmets, tires/tubes) with bikes could improve overall profitability while sustaining bike sales. Bikes contribute 51% of revenue but only have a 3% profit margin, while accessories bring in 33% of revenue with a 19% profit margin.
Bikes lose money in the U.S., likely due to shipping costs, while they are profitable in Europe. Look into different ways to reduce shipping costs in the U.S.
Where should the company focus its expansion efforts?
The U.S. dominates revenue (46%) but underperforms in profit (31%), with almost all sales concentrated in California, Washington, and Oregon. Focus U.S. marketing in these 3 states.
Germany brings in 42% of total profit despite only 19% of revenue, meaning it has the highest profitability.A growth strategy could involve increasing focus on Germany while improving U.S. profitability.
What product strategies can drive higher profits?
Accessories have the highest margins (19%), with helmets and tires/tubes contributing 75% of profit.
Clothing has a strong 16% profit margin, with jerseys making up 55% of clothing profit.
Introducing promotions, bundles, or upselling accessories and jerseys with bike purchases could improve profitability.
How does customer behavior vary by age and gender?
Customers aged 26-35 contribute 36% of revenue, while those aged 36-50 contribute 38%, making them the core target audience.
The dataset does not include purchase frequency per customer, but analyzing repeat purchases by age group could provide insight into customer retention.
What caused the sharp decline in sales in July 2016?
Sales plummeted suddenly in July 2016, and given that the dataset only includes product costs without additional expenses (e.g., rent, utilities), this suggests it is an online business. Potential causes could include seasonality, supply chain disruptions, website issues, or marketing strategy changes. Further investigation into historical trends, marketing campaigns, and inventory levels is needed.
